webcomic-downloader
===================

A simple downloader for the automated downloading of webcomic archives for Python and GTK.

Its end goal is to allow the user to list a bunch of webcomics and have the program download all the comic strip images with as little user direction as possible.

Note that this will require great intelligence on the part of the detection algorithm.
